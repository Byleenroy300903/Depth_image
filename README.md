# Depth_image


This Python script uses the MiDaS (Mixed Data Sampling) model, a deep learning-based method for monocular depth estimation, to estimate the depth and distance between objects in an image. Here's a brief description of the script:

MidasNet Class:

Defines a custom neural network class MidasNet that serves as a wrapper for the MiDaS depth estimation model.
The model is loaded either from the default hub or from a specified checkpoint file.
Image Preprocessing Functions:

convert_to_black_and_white: Converts an input image to black and white.
estimate_depth_and_distance: Takes an image file path, preprocesses the image, runs it through the MiDaS model, and displays the original image, black and white version, and the depth map.
Main Execution Section:

Uploads an image file to Colab.
Downloads the MiDaS model checkpoint from a specified URL.
Initializes an instance of the MidasNet class and loads the adjusted state dictionary.
Calls the estimate_depth_and_distance function with the uploaded image, displaying visualizations of the original image, black and white image, and depth map.
Calculates and prints the estimated distance between two points in the image based on their depth values.
Note:

The script assumes knowledge of the pixel coordinates of two points in the image and uses a simple linear relationship between depth and distance to estimate the distance between those points.
It also includes a color chart at a selected point in the image for visualization purposes.
Dependencies:

PyTorch, torchvision, PIL (Pillow), OpenCV, Matplotlib, Google Colab's files module.
Execution Environment:

The script is designed to run in a Google Colab environment, evident from the import of the google.colab module.
The device for running the MiDaS model is set to 'cuda' if available, otherwise 'cpu'.
Overall, the script provides a convenient way to estimate depth and distance in an image using the MiDaS model, with the flexibility to load the model from a checkpoint file if needed.
